**Version Control System (VCS)**
----------------------------------------------------
What is Version Control System (VCS)?
helps developers track changes, collaborate efficiently, and revert to previous versions of the code when needed. 

Primary challenges addressed by version control systems are:

1.Backup and Restore – Files are safe against accidental losses or mistakes.
2.Collaboration – Multiple people can work on the same project simultaneously.
3.Branching and Merging – Users can diverge from the main base of code, experiment, and then bring changes back in line without losing work.
4.Tracking Changes – You can see specific changes made and by whom.

**Centralized vs. Distributed Version Control**
centralized version control systems like SVN required all code changes to be stored on a central server. This created a single point of failure. Git, a distributed version control system (DVCS), allows developers to maintain local repositories and synchronize with a remote repository like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

Git?
it is a DVCS
allows multiple users to work on the same project while keeping track of changes.
enables team to collaborate efficiently. track modifications and revrt to previous versions when needed.

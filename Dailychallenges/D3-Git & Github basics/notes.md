**Version Control System (VCS)**
What is Version Control System (VCS)?
helps developers track changes, collaborate efficiently, and revert to previous versions of the code when needed. 

Primary challenges addressed by version control systems are:

1.Backup and Restore – Files are safe against accidental losses or mistakes.
2.Collaboration – Multiple people can work on the same project simultaneously.
3.Branching and Merging – Users can diverge from the main base of code, experiment, and then bring changes back in line without losing work.
4.Tracking Changes – You can see specific changes made and by whom.

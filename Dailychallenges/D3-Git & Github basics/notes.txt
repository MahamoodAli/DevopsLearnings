Version Control System (VCS)
What is Version Control System (VCS)?
Version Control Systems (VCS) help developers track changes, collaborate efficiently, and revert to previous versions of the code when needed. The two primary challenges addressed by version control systems are:

Backup and Restore – Files are safe against accidental losses or mistakes.
Collaboration – Multiple people can work on the same project simultaneously.
Branching and Merging – Users can diverge from the main base of code, experiment, and then bring changes back in line without losing work.
Tracking Changes – You can see specific changes made and by whom.
